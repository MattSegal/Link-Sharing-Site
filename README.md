### Overview
The aim of this website is to allow me and my friends to share interesting links with each other.

I initially made this site to help me learn Flask and JavaScript/jQuery in 2015.
I refactored the front-end to use TypeScript and the backend to use SQLAlchemy in 2016.
Now in 2017 I've re-written the back-end in Django and the front-end with React/Redux to help me learn these frameworks.

### Stack
* Django
* React/Redux + ES6
* SASS


### TODO

- add search
    - user name
    - title
    - domain
    - path
    - time?
