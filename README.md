# Link-Sharing-Website

[View Live Website Here](http://www.mattdsegal.com/links)

### Overview
The aim of this website is to allow me and my friends to share interesting links with each other. 

I initially made this site to help me learn JavaScript/jQuery in 2015. Now I'm looking to expand its features and learn TypeScript
  
### To Do - New Features
* Add optional link description to each link
* Add a refresh button or polling mechanism to keep content up to date
* Add list manipulations:
	- filter on tags 
	- change order
* Detect gifs / images and optionally show them
* Add user accounts and logins
	- Only authorised users can edit/delete links (optional?)

### To Do - Improvements
* Move the add link button to the top
* Make the MYSQL db easier to deploy
* Add automatic db backups
* Add selenium regression tests
* Add API regression tests
* Add responsive design back again
