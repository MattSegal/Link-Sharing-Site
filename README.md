# Link-Sharing-Website

[View Live Website Here](http://mattsegal.xyz/links)

### Overview
Having learned some JavaScript/jQuery I wanted to apply what I had learned with a small practical project. This project includes both the front-end (HTML/CSS/JS) and the back-end (Flask/MySQL/Apache2). The aim of this website is to allow me and my friends to share interesting links with each other. 
  
### Current Bugs
* Navigating to another site and then pressing 'back' causes links to not re-load
  
### To Do - Improvements
* implement a MVC design pattern
* continue to fight the spaghetti
* add a front page and load all links using a single GET request, rather than every time a user is loaded

### To Do - New Features
* add optional link description to each link
* record number of views or link clicks for each link
* allow user to recommend each links to other users
